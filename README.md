# MyTranslatorProject
Documents translated into Chinese and original English files / 翻译成中文的文档和英文原始文件

In actual, this project is almost meaningless, because a translation for technical manual can be easily obtained through any translation software nowadays. Network Management Committee (NMC) is a student community at my university. The first document revealed in this repository is translated for new students who join this club. I hope to help them get familiar with and master this operating system as soon as possible to help other students. The failure of Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 makes many people not familiar with the new feature introduced in these two OS, much less the new features in Windows 10. The pictures in the documents are also localized in Chinese, and I cannot remember how many virtual machines I have built for restoring the scenario in each chapter.

实际上，这个项目几乎毫无意义，因为现在可以通过任何翻译软件轻松获得技术手册的翻译。 网络管理协会（NMC）是我所在大学的一个学生社团。本资料库中显示的第一份文件是为加入此社团的新生翻译的，希望能够帮助他们尽快熟悉和掌握这个操作系统，来给其他同学提供帮助。 Windows 8和Windows 8.1的失败让很多人不熟悉这两个操作系统中引入的新功能，更不用说Windows 10中的新功能了。文档中的图片也用中文本地化了，也记不清我到底构建了多少虚拟机来复现各章节中的不同场景。
